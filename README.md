Oregon_Trail
============
This is a project I initially made to learn about Pygame, but I took it quite a bit further and learned a lot.
This is not by any means a properly written code, there are a lot of parts I'm very unhappy with.

This was more of a documentation of my personal development in programming than anything.



This relies on the Pygame module (Download found here http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) 

And the EZText module (Download found here http://pygame.org/project-EzText-920-.html)
