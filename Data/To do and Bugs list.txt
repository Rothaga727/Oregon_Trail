Project: Oregon Trail Remake


Bugs:

1. When choosing faces, "No face is chosen!" is printed before the player has a chance to choose a face.
[FIXED]2. You're able to sell more food than you have
[FIXED]3. Cloud and tree generation at the start is buggy, leaves a gap.
4. The clouds are visually popping up as they move onto the screen
5. The tombstone placement is very buggy when using higher than normal move_value
[FIXED]6. After killing a passenger in the Turn Menu, the Next Day rectangle is below the image


To do:

[DONE]1. Maybe rework the Game.char_create() function so that it's not 130 lines long.

[DONE]2. Instead of passing group_inventory and group_money to the Shop.update() function, just do the calculations using Shop.group_inventory and Shop.group_money.

3. class AfflictionBox too similar to class MenuButton?

4. Maybe create a new class for the shop tabs? Might shorten things up and improve readability

5. Perhaps create a dictionary that holds all of the functions for events in Turn Menu section

6. Way too many font definitions. Maybe just have 1 or 2 in the Game.__init__()

7. Dynamic terrain generation -- Snowflake chance in winter, raindrop chance in summer, tree model, etc.

8. Add a difficulty setting that changes the starting food, price modification, disease chance, etc.

[DONE]9. Create an output box similar to the Logbook to show after every turn

[DONE]10. Add the hunting minigame to bring in more food

11. Rework the movespeed and move_value, lots of bugs and just generally messy.

12. Touch up on the tombstone_info placement, displays under the output_box often.

13. Incorperate some sounds
